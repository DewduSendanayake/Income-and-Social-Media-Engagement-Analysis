# Income Vs Social Media Engagement 💸

Welcome to the **Relationship Between Income and Social Media Behavior** project! This repository houses my empirical analysis of how digital habits intersect with personal finances, powered by a 5,000–user dataset.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Objective:** Investigate whether income levels are associated with social media engagement metrics, such as addiction score, session intensity, platform choice, debt status, and property ownership.

**Key Findings:**
- **Null Results:** No significant link between income and addiction, session intensity, or platform used.
- **Counterintuitive Insight:** Users with debt tended to have higher incomes—suggesting credit access as a proxy for earning power.
